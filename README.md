# Active-Directory-Project

## Objective

This project is aimed to create an environment using Active Directory with the objective to learn how to setup this tool and how it can manage
Domains, Users, and machines. Also we will be using a Linux server tu create a Splunk SIEM instance to monitor the machines managed by the
Active Directory Domain so that we can generate telemetry and learn how different attacks look like in a SIEM environment, to achieve this we will alse be using
Kali Linux as an attacker machine using a Brute Force attack to attack the machines within the Active Directory Domain.

Explanation of the colored lines:

- The green dotted arrow going from our PC with Windows 10 to the Splunk Server indicates that it will forward data to Splunk.

- The green dotted line going from Active Directory Server to Splunk Server indicates that it will also forward data to Splunk.
